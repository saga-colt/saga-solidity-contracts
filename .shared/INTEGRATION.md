# Integration Guide for AI Agents

This guide provides detailed instructions for AI agents to integrate shared-hardhat-tools into dTrinity network repositories.

## Quick Start for AI Agents

When asked to integrate shared tools into a network repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Minimal Integration (Recommended First Step)

```bash
# Add subtree at .shared directory
git subtree add --prefix=.shared https://github.com/dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools.git main --squash

# Alternative when the shared repo lives beside the target repo
# git subtree add --prefix=.shared ../shared-hardhat-tools main --squash

# Install the local package (enables the setup script and portal resolution)
npm install file:./.shared

# The shared package ships with ts-node/typescript, so this step ensures the CLI
# is available without extra dependencies in the consuming repo.

# Run the setup script with a minimal phase to verify the integration and add
# baseline npm scripts.
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --package-scripts

# The setup script performs preflight validation (git repo, .shared subtree,
# hardhat.config.* present, readable package.json) before making changes. Add
# --hooks, --configs, or --ci when you're ready to install those assets.
```

Immediately switch the dependency to the portal protocol so Yarn references the subtree directly and
no longer repacks it (eliminates macOS extended attributes and checksum drift):

```bash
# package.json
"dependencies": {
  "@dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools": "portal:.shared"
}

# Regenerate the lockfile to capture the portal entry (run inside Linux CI or
# disable macOS extended attributes)
COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 yarn install --mode=update-lockfile
```

If `npm install file:./.shared` fails because of peer dependency conflicts (common with Hardhat
Toolbox still requiring `@types/chai@^4`), rerun with `--legacy-peer-deps` to reuse the lockfile the
repo already trusts.

> Heads-up: `yarn install --mode=update-lockfile` updates the lockfile only—it skips linking. Run a
> plain `yarn install` afterwards when the repository uses `nodeLinker: node-modules`; otherwise new
> shared dependencies (`@safe-global/*`, etc.) will be missing during the first `make roles.*` run.

#### Hook up the shared Makefile

Add the following to the repository `Makefile` (create one if it does not exist):

```make
# shared targets live here; define project-specific targets after this line
include .shared/Makefile
```

The include injects the common `make lint`, `make lint.ci`, `make slither`, and guardrail helper targets so teams keep familiar workflows while relying on the shared TypeScript tooling.

Immediately after the include, add a few defaults so the shared role automation can run without extra flags:

```make
ROLES_NETWORK ?= katana_mainnet
ROLES_MANIFEST ?= manifests/katana-mainnet-roles.json
ROLES_SCAN_ARGS ?= --drift-check
ROLES_TRANSFER_ARGS ?=
ROLES_REVOKE_ARGS ?=
```

> Tip: When you rely on `?=` for these defaults, declare the block *before* `include .shared/Makefile`. The shared file seeds empty placeholders during the include, so setting them earlier (or switching to `:=` afterwards) keeps `make roles.scan` / `make roles.transfer` wired up with sensible defaults.

Have repo-specific `slither` automation or a custom `help` target? Top-level duplicates trigger GNU Make warnings. Set `SHARED_ENABLE_SLITHER_TARGETS := 0` (and drop bespoke `help:` rules) ahead of the include when you need to preserve local implementations.

With those in place you can invoke `make roles.scan`, `make roles.transfer`, or `make roles.revoke` directly. The deployer / governance addresses are pulled from the manifest, and `roles.revoke` also reads the Safe configuration (`safe.safeAddress` / `safe.chainId`) unless you override them explicitly. To customise behaviour on the fly, pass the exposed variables inline:

```bash
# run drift check and persist the JSON summary
make roles.scan ROLES_SCAN_ARGS="--drift-check --json-output reports/roles/scan.json"
# dry-run transfers
make roles.transfer ROLES_TRANSFER_ARGS="--dry-run-only"
# target an alternate manifest / Safe combo
make roles.revoke manifest=manifests/katana-testnet-roles.json
```

When repositories keep TypeScript sources outside the default Hardhat `tsconfig.json`, add a thin wrapper such as `tsconfig.shared.json` that extends `./.shared/tsconfig.json` and lists `node`, `hardhat`, and `hardhat-deploy` in `compilerOptions.types`. Point `TS_NODE_PROJECT` (see Katana/Fraxtal `Makefile` examples) at this file so the shared CLI compiles without missing-type errors.

Shared role targets write JSON artefacts under `reports/roles/`; add `reports/**/*.json` (or a narrower glob) to `.gitignore` so drift outputs do not clutter commits.

#### Enable the shared GitHub Actions workflow

Add the guardrail workflow so CI runs the shared lint/compile/test suite on every push and PR:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp .shared/ci/shared-guardrails.yml .github/workflows/shared-guardrails.yml
```

Commit the workflow file alongside your integration changes. GitHub automatically activates the workflow once it lands on the default branch.

#### Align Prettier configuration across machines

If the repository does not already define a Prettier config, add a shim that delegates to the shared settings:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > prettier.config.cjs
module.exports = require('./.shared/configs/prettier.config.cjs');
EOF
```

This keeps editor integrations, ad-hoc `yarn prettier` runs, and the guardrails in sync.

#### Install the shared git hooks

Enable the shared git hooks so formatting and guardrails run locally before code reaches CI:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --hooks                       # installs the pre-push hook
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --hooks --include-pre-commit-hook # opt into the pre-commit hook
```

The pre-push hook executes the shared guardrail suite with `--fail-fast`, runs Prettier/ESLint/Solhint, and
executes `npx hardhat test` by default. Because the hook scripts live inside `.shared`, future updates to the tooling
automatically flow into every repository. Add `--include-pre-commit-hook` whenever you want the additional
staged-file linting and compile guard that the shared pre-commit hook provides.

> **Heads-up:** The default pre-push flow now blocks on Prettier. Please fix formatting before pushing instead of
> suppressing the guard via `SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_PUSH_PRETTIER=0`. A quick way to sweep the tree is:
>
> ```bash
> node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/linting/prettier.ts --write
> ```
>
> Only reach for the skip flag when you’re actively landing the formatter fix, and remember to re-enable it afterwards.

**Yarn Berry note:** the shared package expects the `node-modules` linker (`.yarnrc.yml` with `nodeLinker: node-modules`)
so that Node ambient typings and shared binaries resolve consistently. Switch existing repos with:

```bash
echo "nodeLinker: node-modules" > .yarnrc.yml
yarn install --mode=update-lockfile
```

> Prefer automation over manual flags? When you have access to this repository
> locally, `bash path/to/scripts/subtree/add.sh --help` prints the non-
> interactive wrapper that enforces a clean worktree and requires
> `--force-remove` before replacing an existing `.shared` directory.

### 2. Test Basic Functionality

> The commands below call `node_modules/.bin/ts-node` explicitly so they use the
> bundled runtime without relying on global installs. If your environment adds
> `node_modules/.bin` to `PATH`, you can drop the prefix.

```bash
# Test that the package is accessible
node_modules/.bin/ts-node -e "const tools = require('@dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools'); console.log('Tools loaded:', Object.keys(tools));"

# Test a simple script
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/analysis/solhint.ts --help 2>/dev/null || echo "Script executable"

# Optional: lint a narrow slice (requires repo ESLint deps)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/linting/eslint.ts --pattern 'typescript/**/*.ts' --quiet || true

# Optional: guardrail dry run (skip heavy checks at first)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/guardrails/check.ts --skip-prettier --skip-solhint || true

# Optional: ensure Slither is available (installs via pipx/pip if missing)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/analysis/install-slither.ts || true

# Optional: run the shared Slither default preset (mirrors Sonic's Makefile target)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/analysis/slither.ts default || true

# Optional: confirm deploy scripts reference shared IDs (provide custom paths if needed)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/deployments/find-hardcoded-deploy-ids.ts --quiet || true

# Optional: dry-run deployment cleanup (keywords match migrations entries + filenames)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/deployments/clean-deployments.ts --network mainnet --keywords Vault --dry-run || true

# Optional: summarize deployment addresses or oracle sources
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/deployments/print-contract-addresses.ts --network mainnet || true
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/deployments/print-oracle-sources.ts --network mainnet --json || true

# Optional: generate an nSLOC report (writes to reports/nsloc.md by default)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/deployments/nsloc.ts || true
```
Run these from the repository root so guardrail validation can find `package.json` and `hardhat.config.*`. Expect non-zero exits when formatting issues are discovered—that simply means the guards are working.


### 3. Conservative Integration Steps

Start with these minimal changes:

#### A. Add Package Scripts (package.json)
```bash
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --package-scripts
```

The setup script adds or normalizes the shared baseline (`analyze:shared`, `lint:*`, `guardrails:check`, `shared:update`).
If any script already exists with custom behavior, the tool reports it as a manual follow-up instead of overwriting.
The lint entries assume the project already includes ESLint/Prettier (most repos do). Start with small `--pattern`
scopes or the `--skip-prettier` flag when introducing them to an older codebase.


#### B. Optional: Copy One Config
```bash
# Only if project doesn't have .solhint.json
cp .shared/configs/solhint.json .solhint.shared.json
```

### 4. Verify Integration

```bash
# Check subtree was added
ls -la .shared/

# Check package installed (npm ls reports file: deps as "invalid")
yarn list --pattern @dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools

# Test a command (non-destructive)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/analysis/solhint.ts --quiet --max-warnings 0 || true
```

## End-to-End Subtree Lifecycle

### First Integration Runbook

1. **Start clean** – abort if `git status --short` is non-empty. Fix compilation locally so guardrails have a stable baseline.
2. **Add the subtree** – prefer the wrapper: `bash scripts/subtree/add.sh --repo-url https://github.com/dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools.git --branch main --prefix .shared`. Pass `--force-remove` only when replacing an existing directory after backing it up.
3. **Install the package** – `npm install file:./.shared` (or the equivalent `yarn/pnpm` command) so the bundled `ts-node` runtime is available. For Yarn Berry projects, follow immediately with `yarn install --mode=update-lockfile` to capture the new `file:` dependency so later `yarn install --immutable` checks succeed.

### Keeping subtrees fresh

1. Track the commit SHA applied to the repository (add it to the PR body or changelog).
2. Future updates become `git subtree pull --prefix=.shared https://github.com/dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools.git <new-sha> --squash`.
3. Re-run `yarn install --mode=update-lockfile` (Yarn Berry) or the equivalent install command so lockfiles capture the new tree.
4. Re-run `node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --hooks --force` to make sure the latest hook wiring is present.
5. Run `node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/linting/prettier.ts --write` followed by `make lint`/`make test` to confirm the repo is still healthy.

### Rollout learnings

- **Prettier enforcement pays off.** Leaving `SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_PUSH_PRETTIER` at its default forces teams to fix formatting once instead of repeatedly skipping it. Add the formatter sweep to your upgrade PR so reviewers only have to look at one big diff.
- **Ambient Hardhat/Node typings.** If you hit `TS2307` errors for built-in Node modules after updating the subtree, confirm that `types/ambient-hardhat.d.ts` and `types/node-globals.d.ts` are present and that your Yarn linker is set to `node-modules`.
- **Berry + subtrees.** Yarn 4 projects should keep `.yarnrc.yml` committed alongside the subtree to avoid accidental PnP installs, otherwise the shared scripts can’t locate ambient type definitions or the bundled `ts-node`.
- **Document the SHA.** Every shared update should call out the exact commit (`git subtree add/pull --prefix=.shared … <sha>`) in the PR description so future pulls can anchor to the same point.
4. **Run the setup preflight** – execute `node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --package-scripts` to add baseline npm scripts and surface missing prerequisites. Loop back with `--hooks`, `--configs`, or `--ci` once stakeholders sign off (teams sometimes stage those phases in their second pass, but do not forget them).
5. **Wire automation** – copy `.shared/ci/shared-guardrails.yml` into `.github/workflows/shared-guardrails.yml`, add a root `prettier.config.cjs` that re-exports `.shared/configs/prettier.config.cjs`, and stage both files with the rest of the integration diff so CI and local tooling stay in sync.
6. **Take a smoke-test lap** – run `npm run --prefix .shared lint:eslint -- --pattern 'hardhat.config.ts'`, `npm run --prefix .shared sanity:deploy-ids -- --quiet`, and either `npm run guardrails:check -- --skip-prettier --skip-solhint` (if the package script is wired up) or `npm run --prefix .shared guardrails:check -- --skip-prettier --skip-solhint` to confirm the shared tooling works in situ before committing. Drop the skips once formatting lands.

### Updating the Subtree

1. **Fetch the latest source** – from within the network repo, run `bash .shared/scripts/subtree/update.sh --repo-url ../shared-hardhat-tools --branch main`. Add `--stash` if local changes need to be preserved.
2. **Reinstall if needed** – if `.shared/package.json` or lockfiles changed, rerun your package manager so the new dependencies land.
3. **Re-apply setup phases** – execute `node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --package-scripts --hooks --configs --ci` (use only the phases you rely on) to pick up new defaults without clobbering overrides.
4. **Validate guardrails** – `npm run --prefix .shared test` plus a targeted guardrail command (`npm run --prefix .shared guardrails:check -- --fail-fast`) ensures the update behaves before opening a PR.
5. **Commit with intent** – stage the `.shared` diff (and any lockfile changes), write a commit message that points to the shared repo tag or commit, and describe any manual steps consumers must perform.

### Post-Update Validation

After large updates, capture a quick status report in the PR description:
- Which commands were executed (lint, sanity checks, tests)
- Whether `reports/` artifacts were reviewed
- Any environment variables that had to be toggled
- Follow-ups uncovered for downstream documentation or tooling

## Important Context for AI Agents

### Updating the Subtree Safely

```bash
# Default: requires a clean worktree
bash .shared/scripts/subtree/update.sh

# Common helpers
bash .shared/scripts/subtree/update.sh --stash       # auto-stash + restore
bash .shared/scripts/subtree/update.sh --allow-dirty # bypass the safety check entirely
```

> The helper intentionally skips package installs and hook syncing. After a
> pull, review the diff, run your package manager if `package.json` changed,
> and re-run the setup script for any phases that should pick up new assets.

### CI Wiring Checklist

1. **Ensure scripts exist** – confirm `package.json` exposes `guardrails:check`, `sanity:deploy-ids`, and the shared `lint:*` entries (or capture repo-specific equivalents). The setup script reports anything missing.
2. **Install the shared package in CI** – add `npm install file:./.shared` (or `yarn add file:./.shared`) before calling the guardrail workflow so `ts-node` is on the PATH.
3. **Reference the shared workflow** – commit `.github/workflows/shared-guardrails.yml` copied from `.shared/ci/shared-guardrails.yml` (or run the setup script with `--ci` to place it).
4. **Keep reports tidy** – ensure `reports/` is ignored locally; CI will upload artifacts automatically. Download them when diagnosing failing runs.
5. **Stack extra jobs** – add repo-specific jobs (deployments, simulations) after the shared guardrails job, or run the shared workflow from a parent pipeline for consistency across repos.

### DO NOT on First Integration:
- ❌ Do not overwrite existing configurations without reading the diff – stage only the portions you intend to adopt.
- ❌ Do not toggle git hooks or CI workflows without coordinating with the team; document any deferrals.
- ❌ Do not ignore guardrail or hook failures once they are enabled – fix them locally so CI mirrors your workstation.
- ❌ Do not run heavyweight security scans or repo-wide Prettier sweeps on the very first pass—start with targeted patterns or skip flags.
- ❌ Do not commit transient artifacts (reports/, cache/, coverage/) produced during validation runs.

### DO on First Integration:
- ✅ Add the `.shared` subtree and install it as a local package so the tooling is available immediately.
- ✅ Run `node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --package-scripts` and capture follow-ups for hooks/configs/ci phases if they must land later.
- ✅ Copy `.shared/ci/shared-guardrails.yml` into `.github/workflows/shared-guardrails.yml` and add `prettier.config.cjs` that re-exports the shared config once stakeholders are ready (track the TODO if deferred).
- ✅ Dry-run shared linting/guardrail scripts with conservative options (patterns, `--skip-prettier`, `--skip-solhint`) before pushing.
- ✅ Summarize the commands you executed in the PR description so reviewers know the validation surface and open follow-ups.

### Testing Commands (Safe)

These commands are safe to run and won't modify files:

```bash
# List available scripts
ls .shared/scripts/analysis/

# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit --project .shared/tsconfig.json

# Test imports
node_modules/.bin/ts-node -e "
const { logger, configLoader } = require('@dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools');
logger.info('Shared tools integrated successfully');
"

# Try ESLint on a narrow slice
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/linting/eslint.ts --pattern 'typescript/**/*.ts' --quiet || true

# Guardrail dry run (skips heavy checks)
node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/guardrails/check.ts --skip-prettier --skip-solhint || true
```

### Network-Specific Considerations

Each network may have different:
- Solidity versions (check pragma in contracts)
- Dependencies (check package.json)
- CI/CD setups (check .github/workflows)
- Existing tools (check for .solhint.json, slither.config.json)

### Rollback if Needed

```bash
# Remove subtree (if integration fails)
git rm -rf .shared
git commit -m "Remove shared tools for debugging"

# Remove from package.json
npm uninstall @dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools
```

## Release Cadence & Propagation

1. **Batch changes weekly** – keep `shared-hardhat-tools` improvements on feature branches, then merge into `main` once smoke tests pass locally (`npm test`).
2. **Dogfood in Sonic** – refresh the `.shared` subtree inside `sonic-solidity-contracts@test-shared-tools-integration`, install dependencies, and run `npm test`, `npm run --prefix .shared guardrails:check -- --fail-fast`, and at least one Slither preset. Note any manual tweaks required.
3. **Tag the release** – when Sonic is clean, tag the shared repo (`git tag v1.X.Y && git push origin v1.X.Y`) and jot down a short summary (changed scripts, new docs, required env vars).
4. **Cascade across networks** – open PRs (or provide commands) for every Hardhat repo: `bash .shared/scripts/subtree/update.sh --repo-url https://github.com/dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools.git --branch main`, rerun `setup.ts`, and attach the release notes.
5. **Record the outcome** – update `WIP.md` with the tag, dogfooding notes, and any follow-ups discovered so the next cycle starts with context.

### Multi-Repo Validation Flow

- Before announcing a release, run `npm run validate:matrix` so lint, compile, and test commands pass on every Hardhat repo.
- The CLI accepts repeated `--repo name=/path/to/repo` flags or a config file (`configs/validation.sample.json`) with shared defaults and per-repo overrides.
- Add `--task` to change the global task list, `--command lint="yarn lint"` to override specific commands, and `--install` (or repo-level `install: true`) to reinstall dependencies first.
- Provide `--report reports/validation.json` to emit a machine-readable summary with durations, exit codes, and skip reasons for release notes.
- Fallback commands run via `npx`, so lint/compile can succeed even when a repo hasn’t re-installed its workspace dependencies yet.
- The script still auto-detects npm/yarn/pnpm and stops after the first failure for a repo so you can triage issues before syncing other networks.
- `configs/validation.networks.json` lists the current Hardhat repos (lint + compile with installs) so agents can kick off the full fleet sweep with one flag.

```bash
# Validate Sonic only
npm run validate:matrix -- --repo sonic=../sonic-solidity-contracts

# Drive the run from a config file and record a summary
npm run validate:matrix -- --config configs/validation.sample.json --install --report reports/validation.json
npm run validate:matrix -- --config configs/validation.networks.json --report reports/validation.json
```

## Full Integration Checklist (For Later)

Once minimal integration is verified, consider:

- [ ] Set up git hooks: `node_modules/.bin/ts-node .shared/scripts/setup.ts --hooks` (add `--include-pre-commit-hook`
      to opt into the shared pre-commit checks)
  - Pre-commit executes guardrails and staged-file heuristics; keep Prettier on unless you opt out (`SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_COMMIT_PRETTIER=0`) and compile contracts by default (`SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_COMMIT_COMPILE=0` to skip).
  - Pre-push reruns guardrails, optionally runs tests (`SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_PUSH_TEST=1`) or a custom command (`SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_PUSH_TEST_CMD="yarn test --runInBand"`), enables Prettier with `SHARED_HARDHAT_PRE_PUSH_PRETTIER=1`, and requires Slither only on `main`/`master`/`develop`.
- [ ] Add shared CI workflow: `cp .shared/ci/shared-guardrails.yml .github/workflows/` (runs lint + sanity checks, Hardhat compile, and tests with a summary step)
- [ ] Configure the deploy ID sanity check (`sanity:deploy-ids` npm script or direct call with repo-specific `--deploy-ids/--deploy-root` arguments)
- [ ] Use the deployment helpers when needed:
  - `sanity:deploy-clean` for pruning migrations + artifact files
  - `sanity:deploy-addresses` to produce contract/address reports
  - `sanity:oracle-addresses` to capture oracle inventories (customise with `--category`/`--exclude`)
  - `metrics:nsloc` for lightweight Solidity metrics snapshots
- [ ] Configure network-specific overrides
- [ ] Run full security analysis: `npm run analyze:shared`
- [ ] Document in project README

> Tip: repos that store deploy IDs outside the default `typescript/deploy-ids.ts`
> path should add a `sanity:deploy-ids` npm script that forwards the correct
> `--deploy-ids`/`--deploy-root` options so CI can execute the check without
> additional configuration.

## Troubleshooting for AI Agents

### Error: `Guardrail checks aborted: project validation failed.`
**Cause**: Guardrails were executed from inside `.shared/` or the repository lacks a `hardhat.config.*` file in its root.
**Solution**: Run the command from the project root and confirm the Hardhat config lives alongside `package.json`.

### Error: `Tooling error: Required tool 'prettier' is not installed`
**Cause**: The consuming repo does not have the expected linting dependency installed.
**Solution**: Install missing devDependencies (e.g., `npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-solidity`), then re-run.

### Error: "Cannot find module '@dtrinity/shared-hardhat-tools'"
**Solution**: Run `npm install file:./.shared`

### Error: "fatal: prefix '.shared' already exists"
**Solution**: Directory exists, either remove it or use different prefix

### Error: "ts-node: command not found"
**Solution**: Re-run `npm install` so the shared subtree's dependencies (which include ts-node and typescript) are installed. If you're testing ad-hoc without updating package.json, prefix commands with `node_modules/.bin/ts-node` from the shared directory so the bundled CLI is used.

### Error: Compilation errors in shared tools
**Solution**: Check TypeScript version compatibility: `npx tsc --version`

### Error: `ENOENT ... node_modules/...` during `yarn install`
**Cause**: The repository still has `node_modules` artifacts produced by `npm install`, which Yarn 4 cannot reconcile.
**Solution**: Remove the existing `node_modules` directory and re-run `yarn install` so Yarn recreates the workspace from scratch.
