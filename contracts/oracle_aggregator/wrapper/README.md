# Risks and considerations

### Why don't we have a generic CompositeOracleWrapper which allows us to composite feeds from different oracle providers?
There is risk in surfacing a partially desynced oracle feed. I'm not sure how big the risk vector but if we decide to mix and match we should do a thorough risk analysis first.
