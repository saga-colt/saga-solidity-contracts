# Overview of Reward Claiming in Aave V3

When a user wants to claim their accrued rewards in Aave V3, the process generally follows these steps, primarily interacting with the `RewardsController` contract:

## Steps for Claiming Rewards

1. **Initiation**: The user (or a contract acting on their behalf) calls one of the claim functions on the `RewardsController`. Common functions include:
   - `claimRewards`: To claim a specific amount of a single reward.
   - `claimAllRewards`: To claim all pending rewards for specified assets.
   - Variants like `claimRewardsToSelf`.

2. **Final Accrual Update**: Before processing the claim, the system ensures the user's reward data is current. It internally runs the accrual logic one last time for the user and the specific assets/rewards being claimed. This updates:
   - The user's personal reward index (`UserData.index`) to the latest global reward index (`RewardData.index`).
   - Adds any newly earned rewards to their `UserData.accrued` balance.

3. **Determine Claimable Amount**: The system determines how much of each reward token the user can claim:
   - For specific amount claims, it's the lesser of the requested amount and the user's `UserData.accrued` balance.
   - For "claim all" type functions, it's the total `UserData.accrued` balance for each relevant reward.

4. **Update Stored Accrued Balance**: The user's `UserData.accrued` balance for the claimed reward(s) is reduced by the amount being claimed. If all accrued rewards for a particular token are claimed, this balance is set to zero.

5. **Token Transfer via `ITransferStrategy`**: The `RewardsController` then instructs a designated `ITransferStrategy` contract to handle the actual payout. Each reward stream (asset/reward pair) is configured with a specific transfer strategy. This strategy contract executes the logic to transfer the claimed reward tokens to the recipient address specified in the claim function (e.g., the user's address or another designated address). This allows for flexibility in how rewards are delivered (e.g., simple ERC20 transfer, pull from a vault).

## Delegating Reward Claiming to a Third Party

Aave V3 includes a mechanism to delegate the authority to claim rewards to a different address. This is particularly useful for smart contracts like vaults or for users who want another address (e.g., a keeper bot) to manage their claims.

### How It Works

1. **Authorization via `setClaimer`**: The address that earns the rewards (e.g., your vault) must first authorize another address (the claimer) to claim rewards on its behalf. This is done by the user calling the `setClaimer(address user, address claimer)` function on the `RewardsController`.
   - `user`: The address of the reward-earning entity (e.g., the vault itself).
   - `claimer`: The address of the third party being granted permission to claim.

2. **Third-Party Claiming Action**: Once the claimer is authorized, they can initiate reward claims for the user by calling specific functions on the `RewardsController`, such as:
   - `claimRewardsOnBehalf(address user, address[] calldata assets, uint256 amount, address to, address reward)`
   - `claimAllRewardsOnBehalf(address user, address[] calldata assets, address to)`

   When the claimer calls these functions:
   - They specify the `user` address (the vault's address) for whom they are claiming.
   - The `msg.sender` of this call is the claimer's address.
   - The `RewardsController` verifies that `msg.sender` is an authorized claimer for the specified `user`.
   - The claimed rewards are sent to the `to` address, which can be the user (the vault), the claimer, or any other address.

This delegation mechanism allows your vault to avoid implementing the detailed Aave reward claiming logic directly. The vault only needs to perform the one-time `setClaimer` transaction. The authorized third party can then handle the subsequent claim operations.
